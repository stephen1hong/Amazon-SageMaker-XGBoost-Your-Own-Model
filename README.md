# Amazon-SageMaker-XGBoost-Your-Own-Model
This work shows how to use a pre-existing scikit-learn trained XGBoost model with the Amazon SageMaker XGBoost Algorithm
container to quickly create a hosted endpoint for that model.

Steps:
* import libraries
* Prepare the dataset for training
* Train the XGBClassifier
* Save the trained model file
* Upload the pre-trained model to S3
* Set up hosting for the model
* Create endpoint configuration
* Create endpoint
* Create endpoint
* Post process the output
* Delete the Endpoint
